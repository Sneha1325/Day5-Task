## üìù Queries in This File

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN ‚Äì Books with Authors
Shows all books, their price, and the author‚Äôs name (if exists):

```sql
SELECT Books.Title AS Book_name,
       Books.Price AS Price,
       Author.Author_Name AS Author
FROM Books
LEFT JOIN Author
ON Books.Author_Id = Author.Author_Id;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ RIGHT JOIN ‚Äì Staff who issued books & Member names
Shows staff details and members for each loan (even if some member/loan missing):

```sql
SELECT Staff.Staff_Id,
       Staff.Staff_Name,
       Loan.Issue_Date AS Given_Date,
       Member.Name AS Student_Name
FROM Member
RIGHT JOIN Loan
ON Loan.Member_Id = Member.Member_Id
RIGHT JOIN Staff
ON Staff.Staff_Id = Loan.Staff_Id
WHERE Member.Name IS NOT NULL;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN ‚Äì Only Books whose Author exists
Shows books and their authors, but only where the author exists:

```sql
SELECT Books.Book_Id,
       Books.Title,
       Author.Author_Name
FROM Books
INNER JOIN Author
ON Books.Author_Id = Author.Author_Id;
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ FULL OUTER JOIN (simulated in MySQL)
MySQL doesn‚Äôt support FULL OUTER JOIN directly. Combine LEFT JOIN + RIGHT JOIN using `UNION`:

```sql
SELECT Books.Book_Id, Books.Title, Author.Author_Name
FROM Books
LEFT JOIN Author
ON Books.Author_Id = Author.Author_Id

UNION

SELECT Books.Book_Id, Books.Title, Author.Author_Name
FROM Books
RIGHT JOIN Author
ON Books.Author_Id = Author.Author_Id;
```

This returns:
- All books (even if no author)
- All authors (even if no book)
